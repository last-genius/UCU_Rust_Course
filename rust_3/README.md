This is a directory with all the Lecture 3 materials, including the
code snippets we used on the lecture.

Instead of retyping or copying them you can just use cargo this way:
```
# Initialize a cargo project in this directory
cargo init

# Run the file you want to check
# Some of the files won't be run, they're just examples for you to read through
cargo run --example name

# Run the tests on the library crate
cargo test
```
